# highwind-child
Another highwind child

This is the first wordpress child theme I wrote. It's my project for learning about that stuff.
Some minor css styling was no problem so far.

Yet - I have the feeling I always reach what I want just somehow. Often enough not realy understanding why it's working.
I'd like to become better in creating propper, simple code, asking the right questions to get some valid answres and understanding all that php magic.
