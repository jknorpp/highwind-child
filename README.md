# highwind-child
Another highwind child

This is the first wordpress child theme I wrote. It's my project for learning about that stuff.
Some minor css styling was no problem so far.

Yet - I'd like to become better in creating propper, simple code, asking the right questions to get some valid answres and understanding all that php magic.
